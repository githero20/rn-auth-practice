# Auth Practice

## Description

A practice app on authentication methods, protected routes in React Native. Using a Firebase backend.

This is my version of the project in the React Native - The Practical Guide (2022) course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on [Udemy] (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/).

It was built entirely with React Native.
